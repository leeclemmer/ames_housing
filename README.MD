# Exploratory Data Analysis of Housing in Ames, Iowa

Author: Lee Clemmer

In this notebook we'll explore the Ames, Iowa Housing Dataset, prepared by Dean De Cock, and described in the paper *[Ames, Iowa: Alternative to the Boston Housing Data as an End of Semester Regression Project](https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf)*.

We start by conducting some exploratory data analysis followed by processing the data based on our findings. The goal is ultimately to accurately predict the sales price of houses in the test set given the data in the training set.
